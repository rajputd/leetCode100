# Leet Code 100

## About

Just a spot to share my leetcode solutions between 
computers as I work through problems. Currently am going
through this [list](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-100-liked/).

Everything is written in Java and setting up the project
should be straightforward. Just clone the project and
build with Maven.
